These files add a backup option to dotProject. It allows you to make backups
of your entire database easily. All you have to do is push a button and the
backup will be generated. You are then presented with a download dialog. You can
save this backup anywhere you want.

To install, create a new directory in the modules directory of dotproject name
'backup' (without quotes). Copy all files into this directory. Open your web-browser
and log in to dotproject. Goto System Admin, View Modules. At the bottom the new module
backup is listed. Press install and the module will be installed. Now press activate and
you're ready.
